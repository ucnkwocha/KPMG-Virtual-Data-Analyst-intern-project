# Introduction

I applied to Forage to participate in the KPMG Data Analyst Intership program. In this project, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has approached KPMG with their transaction data, customer demographic data and customer address data set to effectively analyse and provide professional advice on how best to optimise its marketing strategy.
For this, I have being required to fulfill a range of tasks that align with the responsibilities typically assigned to a data analyst in a professional setting. Throughout this program, I successfully completed three stages of tasks.

1. Data Quality Assessment
2. Data Exploration
3. Data insight/visualization
